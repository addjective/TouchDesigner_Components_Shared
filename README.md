# TouchDesigner Components Shared

A collection of random components, tools, toxs that we use, for anyone to use.

### TABLE_COPY

Constantly needing to copy tables and clear them when working on projects. Instead of making a text file and writing the python everytime, just drag the original to the copy destination and hit the Copytable pulse.

### BUTTON_TIMER

A button that contains a timer in MM:SS format indicating how long it has been pressed. Useful for linking to a Moviefileout TOP to know approx. how long you've been recording a scene.
